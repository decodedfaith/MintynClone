## Project Overview

This project demonstrates my ability to create a simple yet functional iOS application within a time-constrained environment. The goal was to build the following screens and implement their respective functionalities:

- **Login Screen**: Mock login functionality.
- **Home Tab**: Displays a placeholder for the main app content.
- **Settings Tab**: Includes options for System, Legal, and Logout functionalities.

Additionally, I documented potential refactors and enhancements in the `SOLUTION.md` file.
